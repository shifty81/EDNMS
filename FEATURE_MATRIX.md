- 30%: Hybrid flight modes, improved automation
- 10%: Living ecosystem, mega-structures

### 7.2 Accessibility vs Depth
Always provide:
- **Easy Entry**: Tutorial, assist modes, guided progression
- **Depth for Veterans**: Advanced mechanics, skill ceiling, mastery

**Example**: Flight system
- Easy: Flight assist, auto-landing
- Hard: Manual docking, FA-off combat

### 7.3 Solo vs Multiplayer
All features must work in both:
- **Solo**: Full game without other players
- **Co-op**: Shared bases, missions, exploration
- **Competitive**: PvP combat, territory control
